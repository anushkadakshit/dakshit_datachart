<body>
   <p>According to <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Agency-Voter-Registration-Activity/kkum-y97z/about_data">data </a>provided by the mayorâ€™s office, the youth and community development agency has one of the lowest success rates in the amount of clients who send voter registration applications to the NYC Board of Elections. This data analysis includes the top 12 agencies that have data on number of clients served.</p> 

    <p> In the last four years, the youth and community development agency's efficiency in distributing applications was considerably low, with an average of 26 percent of applications distributed out of clients served compared to the corrections agency, which has an almost 87 percent on average. </p>

 <p> It's usually difficult to get voters age 18 to 25 to vote because it is a demographic that has felt exluded from socio-political conversations, especially in the last two elections, said Ashley McPherson, director of programs at <a href="https://dosomething.org/"> DoSomething</a>, a non-profit dedicated to youth outreach. "They didn't feel like their voices were heard and didn't feel like the candidates necessarily represented who they wanted to be selected in the [2024] election," said McPherson. </p> 

 <p>New York City has made voter participation more accessible since 2000 with the Pro-Voter Law, which <a href="https://www.nyccfb.info/law/charter/agency-based-voter-registration/"> requires</a> city agencies to offer voter registration forms to <a href="https://www.populardemocracy.org/news/broken-promise-agency-based-voter-registration-new-york-city">anyone</a> applying for services at any of the 18 agencies. Non-profits like DoSomething bring local artists and activists to New York City schools to encourage young people to register to vote and go to the polls, said McPherson.</p>
